## Data Science Questions:
The four questions I was trying to answer with this project are:
1) How has the number of motor vehicle fatalities progressed from 2013-2022 compared to the number of pedalcyclist fatalities over that same time period?
2) What sport, activity, or piece of equipment is the most and least harmful for children aged younger than 5?
3) Which state had the most motor vehicle traffic crash fatalities out of all traffic fatalities recorded in 2022?
4) Which Texas city had the highest number of traffic incidents in 2022, and how does this compare to the overall traffic fatality rate for each city?
